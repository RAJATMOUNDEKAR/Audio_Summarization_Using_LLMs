## Introduction
Audio offer a wealth of knowledge, but the sheer volume can overwhelm listeners. This project introduces a solution using LLMs to automatically summarize podcast audio, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

## Proposed Solution
Utilizing LLMs for audio-to-text conversion and text summarization, we enhance the podcast experience. We fine-tune models like Google's T5 to generate informative and concise summaries.

## Dataset 
Our dataset comprises 500 audio samples, associated texts, and summaries collected for audio summarization.

## Experiments and Results
We employ OpenAI's Whisper model for audio-to-text conversion and Google's T5 for text summarization. Fine-tuning improves T5's performance, showcasing its effectiveness.

## Conclusion
This research uses LLMs to transform podcasts into digestible summaries. The Whisper model achieves 14.172% WER and 4.611% CER, while T5, with fine-tuning, significantly enhances summarization scores.
